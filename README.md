### Lexically Constrained Decoding with Grid Beam Search

This project is a reference implementation of Grid Beam Search for Lexically Constrained Decoding.

We provide two sample implementations of translation models -- one using our framework for
Neural Interactive Machine Translation, 
and another for models trained with [Nematus](https://github.com/rsennrich/nematus).

Any Nematus model should work out of the box.
